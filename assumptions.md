# Assumptions

1. **Environment**: We assume that you have a Python environment setup, with MongoDB as the database. 

2. **MongoDB Access**: We assume that you have created a MongoDB cluster and have the necessary credentials to access it.

3. **Python Package Installation**: We assume that the necessary Python packages can be installed without issues in your environment.

4. **No Authentication**: For simplicity, we haven't implemented any authentication or user management. We assume that this isn't necessary for your current usage. If it becomes necessary, it would require significant changes to the code.

5. **Data Validation**: We assume that all input data is valid and well-formed. The server does not currently perform exhaustive checks on input data.

6. **Single Server Instance**: This service is currently designed to run on a single server instance. There are no guarantees about behavior if run on multiple instances due to potential race conditions and database synchronization issues.

7. **Usage**: The URL shortening service is intended to be used for legal and non-malicious purposes. We assume users will not try to use this service to spread spam, phishing, or other harmful content.

8. **Traffic**: We assume that this service will not receive massive amounts of traffic. If it does, there may be performance issues and rate limiting could become necessary.

9. **Data Storage**: We assume that the MongoDB instance has sufficient storage to store the shortened URLs and corresponding original URLs.

10. **URL Format**: We assume that all incoming URLs will be well-formed and include a scheme (i.e., "http://" or "https://"). If a URL without a scheme is received, the behavior is undefined. 

Please note that if any of these assumptions do not hold true in your specific use case, modifications to the service may be required.
