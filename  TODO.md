# To-Do List

Here is the list of features and improvements that we plan to work on next:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a user registration and login system, allowing each user to have their own collection of shortened URLs.

2. **Custom Short URLs**: Allow users to specify a custom short URL slug, instead of always using a randomly generated one.

3. **URL Expiry**: Add an option for URLs to expire after a certain time period or number of clicks.

4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard showing statistics such as the number of clicks for each URL, the geographical location of the clicks, etc.

5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.

6. **Bulk URL Shortening**: Allow users to input multiple URLs at once and receive multiple shortened URLs in response.

7. **Improved Error Handling**: More detailed error messages for easier debugging and better user experience.

8. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for all the functions to make sure everything works as expected.

9. **Docker Support**: Provide a Dockerfile for easier deployment.

10. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

These are some of the enhancements we're considering. We're always open to feedback and suggestions from the community, so feel free to open an issue or pull request on GitHub if you have any ideas!
