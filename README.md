# URL Shortening Service

This project is a simple URL shortening service implemented using Python and FastAPI. 

## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to design and implement a URL hashing system that:

- Allows the creation of short, hashed URLs from long URLs
- Can handle long URLs and query parameters without restrictions
- Includes click tracking for hashed URLs
- Can optionally make hashed URLs single-use only
- Prioritizes privacy by not associating clicks with individual users
- Can be used securely, for instance in emails or spreadsheets

## Architecture

This project uses Python and the FastAPI web framework. FastAPI was chosen for its simplicity, speed, and out-of-the-box features such as automatic generation of request validation, JSON serialization, and API documentation.

URL shortening is achieved using the PyShorteners library. This was chosen for its ease of use and support for many popular URL shortening services.

The application uses MongoDB for data persistence. Each shortened URL is stored in the database along with the original URL, a click count, and a flag indicating whether it is single-use.

The project is structured with a focus on simplicity and maintainability. Key components are isolated in separate modules (database operations, URL shortening, and URL redirection), and FastAPI's dependency injection system is used to handle database connection setup and teardown.

## Using the Application

Refer to the [setup.md](setup.md) for instructions on how to deploy and use the application.

## Future Work

See the [todo.md](todo.md) for a list of potential improvements and features that could be added in the future.

## Assumptions
